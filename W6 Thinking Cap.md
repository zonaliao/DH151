# Week 6 Thinking Cap

### 1. What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"
I think that "thick mapping in the digital humanities" is a way to show a set of information visually and through user interaction of geographic information system mapping. It differs from regular "mapping" because it goes more in depth into the surrounding factors that encompass certain areas of the digital map. Rather than just pin pointing locations on the map, thick mapping will include more details about what is invovled within that location.  

### 2. How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life?
