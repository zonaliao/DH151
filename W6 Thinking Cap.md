# Week 6 Thinking Cap

### 1. What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"
I think that "thick mapping in the digital humanities" is a way to show a set of information visually and through viewers interacting with the geographic information system. Thick mapping differs from regular "mapping" because it goes more in depth into topics and other surrounding factors that encompass certain areas on the digital map. Rather than just pin-pointing locations on the map with latitude and longitude or giving directions from point A to point B, thick mapping will include more details about what is invovled within that location. Thick maps could dive deeper into any societal aspect on within a map from topics like climate change to culture to even food; it's the stories behind each spot. 

### 2. How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life?
I think the theory of "thick mapping" helps inform me about the history and background surrounding certain locations around the world. It examines an area in detail which influences the way I would look at the situation. Thick mapping informs me about specific facst I would not have otherwise known like if I were looking at an ocean pollution map compared to a regular map, it would give me insight to how urgent this social issue has become throughout the years.
