# Week 3 Thinking Cap

## UX Design Reaction
Learning about UX Design was really interesting because I didn't know too much about it before, but through watching the video and reading about User Experience I can see how many of the products that we use daily all have some extent of user experience research put into it. They do a lot of research and study human behaviors in order to understand what would be the best way to go about creating a successful product often for customer use. There is a lot more to it than just plain design, so I think it is cool to read about how each tier in the pyramid functions as a multistep process to get to the finalized product. 

## Questions:
1. As a UX Designer, do you do any work that also overlaps with UI Design and how do they function together?
2. What made you get into UX Design and what do you wish you knew before starting this career path?
