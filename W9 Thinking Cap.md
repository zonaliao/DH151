## Response
All the speakers we had for this quarter brought a lot of different insight on each topic that they specified in. I really enjoyed them and all of the speakers have further developed my understanding and interest toward the Digital Humanities field. Alesha Unpingco's presentation about UX and UI was super insightful because I have been looking into that a lot more and it was nice to hear from someone who has first hand experience working in that as their career path. She was able to go into more detail about what the position asks of her and it was interesting to hear her talk about her journey as an English major to someone working in design at Apple and Google.
