## Response
All the speakers we had for this quarter brought a lot of different insight on each topic that they specified in. I really enjoyed them and all of the speakers have further developed my understanding and interest toward the Digital Humanities field. Alesha Unpingco's presentation about UX and UI was super insightful because I have been looking into that a lot more and it was nice to hear from someone who has first hand experience working in that as their career path. She was able to go into more detail about what the position asks of her and it was interesting to hear her talk about her journey from an English major to someone working in design at Apple and Google before. Alesha was able to explaing a littel about the difference between UI/UX and how the process includes designing, prototyping, and launching it. I thought the other speakers like Albert Kochaphum's talk on technology and ethics was very insightful as well. He defines three ethicals terms technological determination, techno-facism, and holism and why it matters to us as researches and technologists. I didn't know too much about these terms before, but he really clarified to the class how social change and technological change needs to be more balanced and we can do that by taking more actioin rather than just showing it.
