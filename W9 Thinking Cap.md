Your final thinking cap assignment is to submit your collective thoughts on our speaker series this quarter:
1. UX/UI with Alesha Unpingco
2. Thick Mapping with Yoh
3. Technology and Ethics with Albert Kochaphum
4. Equity and Justice with Silvia Gonzales

Share your thoughts by reflecting on areas that had an impact on you as a researcher, as a technologist, as a designer, and as a human being. And let us know how this knowledge, coupled with the technological tools you have learned this quarter will empower you moving forward in life.

## Response
All the speakers we had for this quarter brought a lot of different insight into each topic they specified. I really enjoyed them, and all of the speakers have further developed my understanding and interest in the Digital Humanities field. Alesha Unpingco's presentation about UX and UI was super insightful because I have been looking into that a lot more and it was nice to hear from someone who has first-hand experience working in that as their career path. She was able to go into more detail about what the position asks of her and it was interesting to hear her talk about her journey from an English major to someone working in design at Apple and Google before. Alesha was able to explain a little about the difference between UI/UX and how the process includes designing, prototyping, and launching it. 

I thought the other speakers like Albert Kochaphum's talk on technology and ethics were very insightful. He defines three ethicals terms technological determination, techno-fascism, and holism, and why it matters to us as researchers and technologists. I didn't know too much about these terms before, but he really clarified to the class how social change and technological change needs to be more balanced and we can do that by taking more action rather than just showing it. Yoh's presentation on Thick Mapping also reminded us to be more conscious of the background and history that comes with all the lands and maps that we work with. There is so much culture and stories behind all these locations that most people don't know about, so rather than just examining a regular map, thick mapping can give us more narrative for each location because of all the layers behind it.

This tied really well with Silvia Gonzales' talk about equity and justice because her approach to strategic mapping and data included focusing on actual neighborhoods, diversity, and research into the different communities. By working on community-based research, she can work hands-on by going out and making changes to address the lack of equality and diversity within our society. I think all the speakers have brought up a lot of intriguing concepts that we as designers, researchers, and technologists can really dive into and rethink how each of these impacts us and the surrounding community.
