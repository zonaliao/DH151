            <i>Places I have been to that are memorable to me.</i>
        </p>
            <b>Bay Area</b>
            <br>
            I grew up in the Bay Area!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>UCLA</b>
            <br>
            I have all my DMA classes at UCLA's Broad Art Center.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Taiwan</b>
            <br>
            A lot of my relatives are in Taiwan and my parents were both born there and came to the US in their mid-20s.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Japan</b>
            <br>
            Went to Japan when I was 8, but I threw up all over the airplane when we landed and was sick most of the trip. I didn't get to do much, so I really hope I can go back again someday to visit more places there!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>New York</b>
            <br>
            Went there for a summer camp and took the subway around with my family to visit all the tourist sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Hawaii</b>
            <br>
            Visited all the popular sites in Hawaii during a family vacation! Some of my college friends live there too.
