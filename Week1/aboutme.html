        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p><i>Hello!</i> My name is Zona Liao and I am a 3rd year <b>Design Media Arts</b> major and <b>Digital Humanities</b> minor at UCLA. My goals for this course it to learn how to do basic html coding to design websites. I am not too familiar with it and I think that through this course I can know a little more about what Digital Humanities means and be able to expand on some new skills as well.</p>
