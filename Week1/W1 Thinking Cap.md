## What is the site's agenda?
The site's agenda is to showcase college students around the world affected by COVID and their personal thoughts. It is a platform where students can share their experiences during quarantine in the past year. The site gathers data from the responses and takes into account what majority of student's feel about the situation through the most common words used and emotions felt during this troublesome time. 

## Why does this website "speak" to you?
This website "speaks" to me because as a current college student, I can relate to so many of these reflections since I am going through a similar situation. It was created from UCLA's Daily Bruin staff to bring a sense of alone together during this pandemic. 

## How does the mapping work, and does it “work?”
The mapping for this website works through student input, so whenever a student shares their "Unfinished Stories" about COVID it takes into account the location of the user. From there, each student's shared story is placed onto the virtual map and other viewers can see where around the world these students are located. By zooming into a specific area on the map, the numbers for the stories on the map become a more precise location. 

### In your opinion, does it do what it’s supposed to do?
I think it does what it is supposed to do well because students from all over can see that others from even different countries feel the same about the events that have occured since COVID-19. The number of people who have shared their stories on the map is shown with the different sized circles and tint based on location; I think that is an effective way to convey the information because students can see that they are not alone. 

## What technologies does the map use?
This map uses "mapbox" to make the coding for this website simpler and to be able to have that zoom in and out effect. 

## If you could change something, what would it be?
If I could change something, I would probably change the way the stories and data can be viewed so that even just looking at the map page the viewers can still get a feel about how most students are feeling in this situation.
